This is a small map-reduce program which takes the log input of employee gate-pass 

whenever an employee comes in or goes out machine generates a timestamp log

like this

empID       timestamp
704	    2013-01-01 09:28:10.000
1790	  2013-01-01 09:28:13.000
811	    2013-01-01 09:28:17.000
904	    2013-01-01 09:28:24.000
1316	  2013-01-01 09:28:31.000
72	    2013-01-01 09:28:36.000
1009	  2013-01-01 09:28:41.000
1543	  2013-01-01 09:28:48.000
1426	  2013-01-01 09:28:52.000
867	    2013-01-01 09:28:57.000

we have to get the average time spent by each employee per day inside and outside office

like this


empid   date      intime outtime
1	      2013-1-1		7	    0
1	      2013-1-2		7	    1
1	      2013-1-4		3	    2
1	      2013-1-7		5	    2
1	      2013-1-8		6	    2
